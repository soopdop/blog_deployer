## Simple Past vs. Past Progressive
    
### Simple past
- Use the simple past to describe actions, or events that **are completed**. Use the simple past for actions that **happened once** or **repeatedly** in the past.
    - `Company executives decided to market the dolls in China in 2009.`
    - `The company executives visited Malaysia a few times.`
- Past time markers, such as *yesterday, last week, two months ago*, and *in 2011* can be used with the simple past.
    - `Did it get good local advice last time?`

### Past progressive
- Use the past progressive to describe an **activity** or **event in progress** over a period of time in the past.
    - `The company wasn't selling dolls in China at that time.`
    - `What was happening during that period?`

### Simple Past and Past Progressive Contrasted
- Use the past progressive to describe **background activities**. These activities were in progress at the same time as the main event in the sentence. Use the simple past for the **main event**.
    - `They were planning a new advertising campaign` (BACKGROUND ACTIVITY)
    - `in the country, so they did some research on the culture.` (MAIN EVENT)
- Use the simple past, not the past progressive with stative verbs.
    - `The company understood the culture.`
    
### Using Time Clause with Simple Past
The simple past and past progressive are used with time clauses to show the order of two past events.

- Use time clauses beginning with the time words and phrases *after, as soon as, before, once, until, and when* to show the order in which events happened.
    - `When we were doing research on the market, we found out that the ad wasn't appropriate for consumers.`
- Use *when* to introduce the first event, When means "at almost the same time."
    - `When we thought about the low sales,` (FIRST EVENT)
    - `we got a little worried.` (SECOND EVENT)

### Using Time Clauses with Simple Past and Past Progressive
- Use the past progressive to describe an ongoing action. Use *while* or *when* to introduce the ongoing action.
    - `While we were developing an advertising campaign,` (ONGOING EVENT)
    - `I got sick` (INTERRUPTION)    
- Use the simple past to describe an action that **interrupts the ongoing action**. Use *when* to introduce the interruption.
    - `We were discussing the new ad campaign` (ONGOING EVENT)
    - `when we heard about low sales.` (INTERRUPTION)
- Use the past progressive in both clauses to talk about **two actions in progress at the same time**.
    - `While they were studying Malaysian culture, they were developing an advertising campaign.`

## Used To and Would
*Used to* and *would* describe past routines or repeated actions. Use to expresses **states or habits** that existed in the past, **but do not exist now**. *Would* can only express **repeated actions**.

### Use To
- Used to is followed by the base form of the verb. It can be used for **actions** or **states**.
    - `Some companies used to ignore local customs.` (But they don't do that now.)
    - `Where did use to go school when you were young?`
    - `Our company didn't use to ask for advice from the local markets.` (But our company does now.)
- Use the simple past, not *used to*, to talk about **completed actions** in the past.
    - `The company made its sales goals last year.`

### Would
- *Would* is only used for actions, **not states**.
    - `In the past, companies were not(NOT woudln't be) sensitive to local customs.`    
- Use the simple past, not would, to talk about completed actions in the past.
    - `The sales team attended to conference last week.`
