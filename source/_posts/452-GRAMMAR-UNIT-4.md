## 1. Past Perfect

### Forming Past Perfect

### Using Past Perfect with simple Past
* had + p.p.
* had + not + p.p. (for negative)

#### a. When to use Past Perfect
Use the past perfect to describe an event in a time period that **leads up to another past event or time period.** Use the simple past to describe the later event or time period.
> She ***learned*** **(LATER TIME)** that she ***had been*** **(EARLIER TIME)** part of a secret study.

#### b. The Prepositions before, by, or until
The prepositions ***before, by, or until*** can introduce the later time period.
> Their mother ***had known*** **(EARLIER TIME)** about the study ***before*** **(LATER TIME)** her death.
> Sue ***hadn't*** **(EARLIER TIME)** met her sister ***until*** **(LATER TIME)** last year.
> Studies on twins ***had become*** **(EARLIER TIME)** common ***by*** **(LATER TIME)** the 1960s.

#### c. For reasons, For background information
The past perfect is often used to **give reasons** or **background information** for later past events.
> She was late. She ***had forgotten*** **(REASON)** to set her alarm clock.
> He ***had never taken*** **(BACKGROUND INFORMATION)** a subway before he moved to New York.

#### Data from the Real World
* In writing, these verbs are commonly used in the past perfect: ***come, have, leave, make and take.***
* ***Had been*** is the most common past perfect form in speaking and writing. 

## Past Perfect with Time Clauses

### Order of Events

#### a. Using time clause
1. Use time clauses to show two separate past time periods. Use the past perfect to signal an event that **occurred in an earlier time period**.
> Elyse ***had moved*** **by the time** the researchers called her.
2. The time words **after, as soon as, before, by the time, until,** and **when** can introduce the time clauses.
 
#### b. With "before" and "after"
* With *before* and *after*, the **past perfect is not always necessary** because the order is clear. in this case, **past perfect emphasizes the earlier time period**.
> Elyse ***moved*** **before** she met her twin.
> Elyse ***had moved*** **before** she met her twin. (same meaning)

#### c. Time clauses with "when"
1. In time clauses with *when*, the use of the past perfect in the main clause usually shows **a good amount of time between events**. 
> When Paula **met** Elyse, she ***had*** already ***learned*** about research.
2. (나) when 절에 past perfect를 써도 되지만, 대부분의 경우에 주절에 사용한다.

#### d. Event happened very soon after the other
1. The use of *as soon as* with the past perfect shows that one event happened **very soon after the other**.
> **As soon as** the researchers ***had learned*** about the public's reaction to the study, they ***stopped*** it.  
2. The use of the simple past in both clauses shows that one event happened very soon after the other.
    * (나) when + simple past, simple past. 문장의 경우, when 절이 먼저이고 주절이 직후에 일아났음을 말한다 

## Past Perfect Progressive

### Using Past Perfect Progressive

#### a. When to use Past Perfect Progressive

> He looked tired because he had been working all night.
