# My Essay

## Title : My Biggest Challenge

Imagine that **you are** shoveling sand out on the ground all day! ~~Even~~ you don’t **even** know why you are doing **it** as if it happened in the novel “holes - louis sachar”. In Korea, because of historical reasons, young men must join the military service more than once. They can choose one among Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine. Of course, there are a few ways not to join the military service but I thought men must do it for ~~a~~**the** defense of my family and country **, so** I ~~had~~ decided to volunteer for the army. After that, it didn't take a long time to realize that it's my biggest challenge -- and mistake -- in my life.

One cold winter morning, a lot of men, who ~~were almost bald~~ had shaved heads, were gathering in the large yard ~~where~~**which** is army recruit training center's ground. While we were standing there, we kept blowing breath on frozen hand and some of us looked extremely nervous. After we saluted to **our** crying parents, and moved into ~~a~~**the** barrack**s**. ~~That place~~**Which** is smelly and dirty. I thought, "This is **a** nightmare!". It was too late to ~~retrieve~~**change** the situation.
   
We got a lot of severe military training there. On the weekend, we were forcely taken to church or we work**ed** all day so we had almost no break time. I didn't want to open my eyes every morning. I couldn't stop tears when I was on sentry duty staring into empty space. ~~Even~~**Furthermore**, I got a bad fever. I walked weakly while marching in full gear over 40 kilometers. Medicine that **I** received from **the** medical officer didn't help me got better. Instead, I was getting worse. I ~~had~~ had a 38-degree fever for more than 3 weeks. After that time, I realized that he had prescribed the same medicine to all the people who were sick**;** whether they had a headache, stomachache, and fever. It was ~~very~~ ridiculous!
 
Eventually, I was ~~arranged to~~**assigned to the** army crops after 5 weeks training had finished. while I was taking a train to my corps, a warm meal was provided. I sighed deeply of relief. Before I arrived at a destination, I had thought that place would be ~~rather~~**better** than training center **but** that was just ~~my~~**an** illusion. On first day, I thought, "This place is hell!" because there were many hard ~~works~~ **jobs**, more demanding training, dangerous weapons, and crazy **person**. I think the place makes people crazy. 
 
Most People don't know what soldiers do during the daytime. Even many people think soldiers always hang out there. Actually, they always get hard work for maintaining their base such as cleaning the camp, removing weeds, removing stacked snow, painting something, driving a nail, flattering the ground, and etc. Those works are not only dangerous but also never end.

As mentioned above, that place makes ~~person~~**people** crazy. One day my company commander, who **was a** major in the army, shot a cat who lived around our base with revolver. I still haven't understood why he did that. All the people there seemed that they were doing role playing. Private was a slave and Sergent was a king. I looked crazy, too. Imagine that **a** crazy person beside you has a gun or grenades. ~~It~~**That** would be really scary. In fact, a lot of gun accidents have been occurring in the army so far. My corps was no exception. One of us died ~~by~~ **from** exploding grenade.

This paper is not enough to ~~take~~ **tell** my story more vividly. I survived ~~from~~~ there, and I also gave me many positive things. It help~~s~~**ed** me develop my physical strength, makes me understand more about people, and I learned to be more patient. After ~~discharge~~ I was discharged from military service, I studied hard in university so I got good grades in the rest of **my** semesters. If someone gives me an opportunity to reenlist in military service, however, I'll NEVER EVER do that again!!

# My Questions

## bald head
대머리라고 해도 영어에는 차이가 존재하는 것 같다. bald head는 벗겨진 모습을 나타내는 것으로 보인다. 빡빡 민 것은 **shaved head**.

## 관계부사 where
관계부사는 다음 두 문장을 연결한다. 해석은 "~하는 곳", 형태는 의문사절과 같다. 그리고 관계부사 뒤에는 완벽한 문장이 나온다.  

* This house is **the place** + He lives in **the place**.
    * This house is the place **where** he lives.
    * This house is the place he lives. (where 생략)
    * This house is where he lives. (the place 생략)

* They were gathering in the large yard **where** is army recruit training center's ground.
    * 내가 쓴 문장은 관계부사 뒤에 완벽한 문장이 나오지 않았다. 따라서 다음과 같이 고쳐줌.
        * They were gathering in the large yard **which** is army recruit training center's ground.
    * 관계 부사를 써 보려면 어떻게 해야 될까? where가 in which 이므로..
        * **There was army recruit training center's ground where they were gathering.**
        * ...이상하다. 굳이 관계부사를 쓰지 말자.

## 관사 : a barrack, medical officer
* moved into a barrack => moved into the barracks
내가 들어 갔던 barrack은 불특정한 것이 아니라 정해져 있었던 것이라서 the인듯 하고, barrack은 여러개 이므로 복수 인듯.
* medical officer => The medical officer
불특정한 의무장교를 이야기 하는 것이 아니라 정해진 사람이 약을 준 것이므로 the가 맞는 것 같다. 


## Even, I got a bad fever.
even은 접속부사 리스트에 없었다. Furthermore로 자체 수정.

## I had decided, I had had
past perfect을 시도 해 봤으나, 역시 같은 문장 내에 비교 대상이 없으면 어색한 듯 함.

## whether they had a headache, stomachache, or fever
whether는 접속사다. "인지 아닌지" 의 뜻도 있으나 "이든 아니든"의 뜻도 있다. 다음과 같은 형태가 다 됨. or가 중요한 듯.

* A이든 아니든 - whether A or not.
* A이든 B이든 - whether A or B.
* A든 B든 C든 D든 - whether A, B, C, or D.
* 예문을 만들어 보자면,
    * He didn't take care of his children whether they destroyed chair, broke window, **or** hurt. 


## would rather의 사용
*  I had thought that place would be ~~rather~~**better** than training center
말도 안되는 짓을 했다. 여기서는 will에 대한 과거의 의미로 would를 썼고, better가 맞다. rather가 무슨 뜻인지 몰랐으나 그냥 써봄. would rather는 선호를 나타내는 modal이고 한 몸이다. 심지어 would rather와 그냥 rather는 완전 다르네?
* Preference를 나타내는 표현
    * would like
        * I would like **a house** by the ocean.
        * They would like **to improve** their English.
    * would prefer
        * They would prefer **coffee**.
        * They would prefer **to drink coffee**.
    * would rather
        * They would rather **have** coffee than tea.
        * They would rather coffee. **(x)**
        
## crazy person
* person -  한 사람을 지칭한다.
    * John is such a nice **person**.
* persons - person의 복수. 매우 formal한 단어로, 법조계 문서에서 쓴다고 함. 즉 잘 안씀.
* people - 여러 사람을 뜻할 때는 people을 쓴다.
    * **Three people** were interviewed for the job, but only **one person** had the right qualifications and experience.

## It과 That의 차이
http://www3.egloos.com/m/1302384 정리 예정.
 
## Present Perfect

* In fact, a lot of gun accidents have been occurring in the army so far.
이 것이 정말 틀린 문장인지 검증해봐야 한다.
* In fact, a lot of gun accidents **have occurred** in the army **recently**.
스티브는 위과 같이 고쳐 주었으나 내가 원하는 의미는 아니다.

## die from
~으로 죽다. die by가 아님.

## Survive there, Survive from there
그 곳에서 살아남았다고 할때는 Survive there가 맞는데 there 때문인지, survive 때문인지 알 수 없음. 
escape는 escape from there, escape there 뭐가 맞을까?
