# Problem & Solution Essay


## Title : Many Abandoned Pets

Many people have lovely pets, and they truly think the pets are ~~the~~**their** best friends. In our society, however, ~~90 thousand~~ **90,000** pets a year are abandoned by owner**s**. They are neglected outside. They are often killed by someone or **by** a car, **they** eat ~~a~~ rotten food ~~in~~**from** the garbage, and mess up around ~~a~~ trash can**s**. As abandoned pets are ~~increased~~**increasing**, animal abuse is also ~~increased~~**increasing** because some people ~~extremely~~**really** hate them. The problem is getting worse as year**s** go by. It's one of the biggest problems ~~with~~**in** our society. I will suggest some solution**s**.

First, we need an effective system to trace abandoned pet’s owner**s**. In Korea, **the g**~~G~~overnment already has enforced a law about ~~the~~ pet registration ~~since~~**for** last two years, but the problem still hasn't been solved yet. According to the law, pets must be registered and they **must** always carry some types of device for a proof of their identification. There are two types of ID device. One is a microchip that is inserted into pet’s body, and another is a just necklace. Pet owners usually choose the necklace type because of worries about their pet’s health. It’s ~~even~~**also** cheaper than microchips. I think the necklace is not helpful to solve this problem as people can purposely remove the necklace. Therefore, we need to find out a more effective way and build a new system.

Second, we need more shelter for abandoned pets. They are not safe outside. Some people ~~extremely~~**really** hate animals because they believe animals are very dirty and spreading germs to them. For the same reason, almost of the Korean hate the pigeon. It’s one of the ~~important~~ **main** reasons for animal abuse. Some people hurt animals, or kill them, post up ~~a~~ picture**s** of dead animals. In order to prevent such situation**s**, we have to make more shelters keep animals safe.

Third, we should make people pay attention to this issue. Some animal protection groups have already been doing something like ~~it~~**this**, so we should help them more ~~actively~~. The easiest way is **through** a donation. A donation helps them so that they can widely inform ~~to~~ all people by ~~a~~ various means such as a leaflet, the media, the internet, etc. In England, as a good example, organizations such as RSPCA, Cats Protection, the Dogs Trust have been running to protect through a variety of activites animals for a long time.

The more humans become happy, the more animals become unhappy. As our economy has grown recently, **the number of** pet owners have been rapidly increased. Abandoned pets and abuse**d** animal have also increased. Animal abuse is a serious crime, so we have to take it seriously. The most important solution to this problem is to have a concern ~~in~~**for** them.  Making **an** effective system to identify animals and building more animal shelters may **also** be ~~also~~ needed. I expect a better society ~~that~~**where** animals and humans **can** live happily together!
