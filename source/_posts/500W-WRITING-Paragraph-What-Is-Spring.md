## My Paragraph
What Is Spring?

Spring is a season which many people like much.  

Initially, when spring comes, people enjoy a warm weather, and seeing and smelling beautiful flowers. There are a lot of large cherry blossoms and azalea trees in specific place, so many people crowd there to see those spectacular sceneries.

In contrast, spring makes people feel uncomfortable for breathing and get sick. As a result of yellow dust from China and an air getting dry, some people get a slight cold but others who have weak respiratory system could get serious diseases.

Even though people should be careful about their health, most people go outside to enjoy spring. Many families go picnic to enjoy the nature, and others go to the river or park to do something such as riding bike and jogging that they couldnâ€™t do during the winter as cold temperature 

For the above reason, we can guess how people like the spring. In spite of illness of the springtime, many people wearing a mask leave their home to enjoy the spring through various outdoor activities.
