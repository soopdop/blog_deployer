# Grammar presentation

## 1. Present Perfect

(나) 기존에 배운 문법에서는 완료, 결과, 계속, 경험로 구분했었다. 여기서는 **unspecified time in the past, continues to present, recent action**으로 구분 하고 있다.  

### Using Present Perfect

#### Unspecified time 

1. Use the present perfect to describe an action or event that happened at an **unspecified time** in the past.
> Researchers **have discovered** similar traits in successful people.
        

2. The adverbs *already, ever, never* and (not) yet can be used with the present perfect.
> She **has received** an award yet?

    + ever : "at any time in your life". 인생에서의 아무때나.
    + never : "not ever". 인생에서 아무때도 아닌.
    + already : "벌써/이미". 긍정문/의문문. 의문문에서는 '그렇게빨리'를 내포함.
    + yet : "벌써/이미, 아직". 항상 문장의 마지막에 나옴. 긍정문에서는 쓰이지 않음. 의문문에서 already와 같은 뜻.
    + still : "여전히". 부정문에서 쓰임. 일어나야 할 일이 안일어나고 있다는 것을 내포함.

#### Continues to present 
        
1. Use the present perfect for actions or events that started in the past and **continue into the present**.
> How long **has** she **been** a successful businessperson?
        
2. *For, since, so far,*and *still* help link between the past and the present. Other common expressions are all day, all my life, and all year.
> She**'s owned** a successful business for 15 years.
> He **has lived** here all his life.

#### Recent action
        
1. Use the present perfect to describe a **recent action**.
> The judges **have awarded** the Nobel Peace Prize.
        
2. The adverbs *just* and *recently* emphasize the recent past time.
> I **have just discovered** the answer.
          
### Present Perfect with For and Since

1.  For + duration (In negative sentences, *in* may replace *for*)
    > She hasn't worked here **for** several years.
    > She hasn't seen her **in** several years.
2. Since + specific dates or times
    > He has lived here **since** last three years.
   
   
## 2. Present Perfect vs. Present Perfect Progressive

### Similar Meaning: Habitual and Ongoing Actions

1. Use either the present perfect or present perfect progressive for **habitual actions** that began in the past and **continue up** to the present. Some verbs that show habitual action are *live, study, teach, wear, and work.*
    * (나) 위와 같은 동사는 Habitual action으로 p.p.와 p.p.p.가 완전히 같은 뜻이다 . 과거로 부터 현재까지 하고 있는 중.
> Bill Gates **has worked** hard all his life.
> Bill Gates **has been working** hard all his life. (exactly same)

2. Use *how long* to ask about the **duration of habitual actions**.
    * (나) 위 동사에 대해서 how long으로 기간을 물어보면 p.p.나 p.p.p.로 대답할 수 있다. 
> "How long **have** you **lived** here?"
> "I**'ve lived** here for 4 years."
> "How long **have** you **been** living here?" (exactly same)
> "I**'ve been** living here for 4 years." (exactly same)

### Different Meanings: Completed vs. Ongoing Actions

#### A. p.p. / p.p.p. / stative verb
1. Use the present perfect for an event that **was completed at an unspecified time** in the past. 
    * (나) *since/for/so far/all day/all my life* 등 와 같이 계속을 의미하는 구/절이 없을 때는 이미 finished 상태를 나타내는 것으로 보임   
> She **has read** a biography of Gandhi. (She finished it.) 
2. Use the present perfect progressive for **an event that began in the past and is still ongoing. It emphasizes the duration of the activity.** 
    * (나) 계속을 의미하는 구/절이 없어도 계속인 상태. 그리고 그 계속인 상태를 강조 함.
> She **has been** reading a biography of Gandhi. (She is still reading it.)
3. **Stative verbs** are usually in the present perfect.
    * (나) 당연히 Stative 동사는 progressive를 쓸 수 없음.
    * (질문) 어떻게 continue를 표현하는가? (답) Stative verb는 p.p.p.를 쓰지 못해도, 의미상 계속 되고 있음 
> They**'ve been** good friends for ages.
> He**'s had** a lot of experience in this business.
> I**'ve always** liked learning about successful people.

#### B. how many / how long

1. Use the present perfect to express *how much/how many*. 
    * (나) 의미적으로 몇개의 무엇을 했다는 것은 이미 끝난 상태이므로 p.p. 사용. p.p.p.를 사용해도 되지만, 그것은 여러개를 번갈아 가며 동시에 하고 있음을 의미함.
2. Use the present perfect progressive to express *how long*.
    * (나) 위에서 언급한 habitual action 이외의 동사에 대해서는 p.p.p.만 사용한다
    * (질문) p.p.는 쓸수 없는가? 이전에 배운것으로는 for/since를 주면 가능 한 것으로 보이지만 의미가 다른가? 같은가?
