## Present Perfect

기존에 배운 문법에서는 완료, 결과, 계속, 경험로 구분했었다. 여기서는 **unspecified time in the past, continues to present, recent action**으로 구분 하고 있다.  

1. Use the present perfect to describe an action or event that happened at an **unspecified time** in the past.
    `Researchers have discovered similar traits in successful people.`
        
    * The adverbs *already, ever, never* and (not) yet can be used with the present perfect.
        `She has received an award yet?`
        + ever : "at any time in your life". 인생에서의 아무때나.
        + never : "not ever". 인생에서 아무때도 아닌.
        + already : "벌써/이미". 긍정문/의문문. 의문문에서는 '그렇게빨리'를 내포함.
        + yet : "벌써/이미, 아직". 항상 문장의 마지막에 나옴. 긍정문에서는 쓰이지 않음. 의문문에서 already와 같은 뜻.
        + still : "여전히". 부정문에서 쓰임. 일어나야 할 일이 안일어나고 있다는 것을 내포함.
        
2. Use the present perfect for actions or events that started in the past and **continue into the present**.
    `How long has she been a successful businessperson?`
        
    - *For, since, so far,*and *still* help link between the past and the present. Other common expressions are all day, all my life, and all year.
        `She's owned a successful business for 15 years.`
        `He has lived here all his life.`
        
3. Use the present perfect to describe a **recent action**.
    `The judges have awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.`
        
    - The adverbs *just* and *recently* emphasize the recent past time.
        `I have just discovered the answer.`
          
4. Using For and Since
    - For + duration (In negative sentences, *in* may replace *for*
    `She hasn't work here for several years.`
    `She hasn't seen her in several years.`
    - Since + specific dates or times
