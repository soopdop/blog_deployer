## Talk about the group trips you took when you were in school
I remember going on various group trips when I was in school. The most momerable trip was a 3-day school trip. It's enjoyable to think of traveling with friends and I made a lot of great memories. We played various games in the bus on the way to and from. We practiced weeks in advance for events like tanlent shows during the trip. I also remember going on many picnics. We often went to places like theme parks. I can remember eating **(al fresco)** for lunch with my friends. Even now, looking at photos from that time brings **(up)** memories. Finally, I ocassionally went on two-day trips called MT during college. They were a good oppotunaties to make friends and to grow closer. These group trips during my shool years are precious memories.

A: What are you doing? What **(are all)** these photographs.
B: I was cleaning my room, and I found photos **(of our)** class trip.
A: That brings me back. We're so young back then.
B: I'd like to visit this place again sometime.
