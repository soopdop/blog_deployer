## Talk about the things you do when you arrive at a hotel

When I travel, my first order of business is to reserve lodgings. I usually make reservations online **(or)** over the phone. When I get to the hotel, I first **(head)** over to the front desk in the lobby to check in. When I present my name and credit card, and employee confirms my reservation. They ask about my preferences for a room. They then give me a key. When I'm traveling heavy, they ask me whehter I need a **(bellhop)** to help me carry my luggage. When I first get to my room, I take a look around. I then draw the curtains and check out the view outside. When I stay at a hotel that has a nice view, I look **(outside)** for a while. Then I unpack my things. I change into comfortable clothes, and go back downstairs.

A: It's good to see you again. How was your vacation?
B: I was on clould 9. My friend and I went to a resort.
A: Wow! That's sounds great! Did you like your hotel?
B: It was the best hotel I've ever been **(in)**
