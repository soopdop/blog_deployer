## Talk about how you use the GPS

I'm not good with directions, so I always turn on the GPS when I drive somewhere. I'm so used to using **(satnav)** that I don't dare go anywhere without turn-by-turn directions. In the past, I had a navigation device **(instlled)** in my car, but not anymore. Now I have a phone cradle on my dashboard. I put my smartphone in the cradle, and use an navigation app. This app is updated periodically, so it's much more accurate. Also, it's connected to a communication network, so it **(shows)** the quickest route based on real-time traffic info. Depending on the traffic, it can change the route as necessary. Of course, using satnav on the phone drains the battery. That why I always keep a car charger for my phone in the car.

A: Hello. It's me. I'm really sorry, but I'm ruinning late.
B: Oh, no. This is a really important meeting. What's wrong?
A: The (?) in my car broke. I got lost.
B: You should try using a (?) app on your phone.
