## Talk about how you edit pictures you have take in

These Days people take snaphots using their phones or digital cameras. These photos are stored as digital files, so you can edit them as you **(please)**. If a photo is too dark, it can be adjusted to be brighter. If a photo is too big or small, it can be cropped or be **(magnified)**. I often edit photos using a photo-editing app. This app has a lot of cool photo filter that I can use. If I want, I can turn a photograph black and white to change **(up)** the atmosphere. I can add text **(or)** stickers and I can stich together many pictures into one. By applying these photo effects, I can change pictures a lot. It's fun to take pictures these days, but editing them in various ways is where **(it's at)**

A: It's so beautiful here. We should take a selfie toghter.
B: OK, I'll use my phone. Look over here, say kimchi.
B: That's a good one. You should upload it on socail media.
A: I will. The camera on my phone is great.
