## Talk about electric mats

Electric mats are mats that are equiped with electric wires they give **(off)** heat. Usually they are laid out on the bed **(or on)** the floor. They are highly efficient because they only heat a specific area. They also help to cut down on the heating bill. They are simple, but their heating effects are tried and tested. Also, they are available in various shapes and sizes, so they can be used accordingly on beds, sofas around floor.
