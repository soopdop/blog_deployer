## Talk about your cooking skills

I can't cook at a professional level, but I am good enough to **(whip up)** simple food to eat myself. My mother provides me with Banchan. I also buy a lot at supermarkets, so all I need is **(soup or stew)** to have a meal. These days, There are many recipes and cooking instructions on the internet. You can find **(endless)** recipes with a single internet search. There are also many food blogs that contain only recipes. This has made cooking a breeze. Also, there are lots of cooking shows on TV. Many of them show simple preparations so that people can follow along at home. **(I jot down notes)** about the food I want to try. That way, I can try **(them out)** for myself when I have time. I especially like to make **(and eat)** midnight snacks.

A: This soup is really delicious. Where did you get it?
B: I cooked it myself. I'm glad you like it. Would you like some more?
A: Yes please. I can't believe you cooked it. What's your secret?
B: I learned how to make it from a TV program.
