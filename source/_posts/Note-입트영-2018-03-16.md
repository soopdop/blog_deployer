# Dictation
## Talk about how good your memory is

I think I have a good memory. I can remember people's names, film titles, and street addresses off the top of my head. I can also remember what people said or did for extended periods. My friends often **(marvel)** at the things I remember. However, one thing I can't remeber is where I left things. I often have to look around for my wallet or phone. Sometimes, it slips my mind where I left my glasses that I wear at home. Also, often I'm forced to search my car because I forget where I parked it. Ocassionally, I forget things on my to-do list. That's why I developed the habbit of writting down notes in a little note book. If I write down my chores this way, it helps jog my memory.

A: I've packed everything, are you ready to go?
B: I think so, but I think I'm forgetting something.
A: You should double-check. We have planty of time.
B: OK. Let me review my to-do list one more time.
