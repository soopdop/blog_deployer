# Dictation
## Talk about your daily routine

I'm a morning person. Because I'm such an early bird, I **(call it a day)** around midnight. I wake up by six o'clock and start my day. As soon as I wake up, I brush my teeth and hit the shower. Then I **(blow-dry)** my hair and put on my face. A little after seven o'clock I head to work. I get to my office by way of the subway. I usually arrive by 8:30. After working for the day, I punch out at around six or seven. Sometimes I stay longer because I have to work late. When there is an office gathering, I have dinner with my co-workers after office hours. In some cases, office dinners end late. When that happens, the subway and buses are not in operation. If this happens, I have to **(hail)** a taxi to get home.

A: Rise and Shine. It's already eight o'clock.
B: But, it's a weekend. Let me sleep for just one more hour.
A: If you wake up now, you will have more time to do things.
B: I'm not a morning person like you are. Leave me along.
