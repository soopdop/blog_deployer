# Dictation
## Talk about mobile chatting

Most people these days communicate using mobile messengers on their phones. People can hold conversations by typing in text. They can also use emoticons instead to get their message **(across)**
Some emoticons are free, but most have to be purchased for a fee. They are a good way to showcase one's indivisuality. Chatting apps can also be used to share photos and videos. You can even send gift vouchers that can be exchanged for real items. There are also group chatrooms where several people can communicate at once. Some chatrooms are for personal matters. Others are work-related. Because a lot of messages can be sent at once, I turn off the alerts for most group chatrooms.

A: Are you busy? Can you help me with this problem?
B: I have to do something else right now, but I'll get back to you.
A: Thanks. Do you have my phone number?
B: I do, but I will probably send you a mobile message.
