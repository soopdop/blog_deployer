## Talk about mobile tickets

These days you can buy almost anything under the sun using mobile phones. Tickets are among the most frequently purchased items. People use mobile apps to buy tickets for movies or concerts. These days, it's not out of the ordinary to buy train tickets or airline tickets by phone as well. This makes buying tickets in advance much easier as well as adjusting times or receiving refunds. Also, the tickets themselves are digital images, so you don't need to print out **(a)** hard copy. You just take out your phone, and present the image or barcode. Because the ticket is in a phone, it is less likely to be misplaced. It's also easy to take a screenshot of ticket and send it to someone else. Mobile tickets have definitely made our lives much more convinient.
