## Talk about when you're stuck in heavy traffic

Last Friday afternoon, it began to rain cats and dogs. Outside the window, the cars in the road were **(jammed)** up. I predicted in advance that there would be heavy traffic on my way home. The road in front of my office building was badly congested. They couldn't budge an inch. I turned on the radio and took it easy while I went home. Under normal conditions, it only takes 40 minutes, but that day it took twice **(as)** long. I was **(worn out)** by the time I got home. Another time, I was traveling with my family. Not long after emerged onto the highway, the cars were at a crawl. (?) for word, we saw that there was a major accident. The accident was the route of the traffic jam in the surrounding areas. Passing the side of the accident, I resolved to be a safe driver.

A: Are we close to our destination? I'm so bored.
B: I told you it's very far away and it will take a long time.
A: We've been in this car for hours. When can we do something fun?
B: We'll get there when we get there. Try taking a nap.
