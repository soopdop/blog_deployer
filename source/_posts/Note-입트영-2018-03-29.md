## Talk about how you tried to have a positive mindset

There is an old nuget that everyhing is what you make of it. In life, we are met with various stumbling blocks. However, I think it's really important to maintain a positive mindset. At all times, I try to look at **(the bright side of)** things. This help me **(fret)** over things less, and I'm stressed out less often. This state of mind helps me get over hard times. Of course, this is easier said and done. However, if I continue to think positively, things often work out for the best. That's why I try to encourage people to keep their chin up. I often hope that my positive **(demeanor)**, we also be helpful to others.

A: You look upset today. Is something wrong?
B: Everything is wrong. I've never been so stressed out in my life. 
A: Hang in there. Things will work out for the best.
B: Thanks. I wish I could have a positive mindset like you.
