## Talk about the cafeteria you go to

I usually eat lunch at the company cafeteria located on the underground floor of the building. This save the trobule of going out to eat and the prices are relatively cheap. I buy meal ticket on a monthly basis. At the cafeteria, there are annoucement of what will be served on each day of the week. Usually, I can select one of the two choices each day. One choice is Korean food and the other is Western. I pick up a food tray and dining **(utensils)** and get in line. I receive rice, side dishes, and soup. There is always salad and sald dressing as a side dish. Additional **(condiments)** like gochujang, dried seaweed, and **(sesame)** oil are always offered, so you can mix them with rice. There is also with sweat rice drink called Sikhe that you can have. After eating, I return my tray at the tray return window.

A: It's time for lunch already. Where should we eat?
B: I'm very busy today. Let's just eat at the company cafeteria.
A: Again? I'm sick of that place. Let's go some place else.
B: OK, then how about the sandwich place across the street?
