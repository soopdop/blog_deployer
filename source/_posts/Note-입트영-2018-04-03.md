# Dictation
## Talk about the things you always carry aournd

There are some **(odds and ends)** that I always carry around in my pocket. First of all, my mobile phone is a must-have. I can't do without it because I need to stay in touch with other people. I also need it to keep an eye on the time or to check the weather. In addition, I use my phone to search the web, collect loyalty point, and identify myself. These days, I store my credit cards and transit cards in my phone case as well. I also carry some lip balm at all times. My lips dry out and get chapped often, so I apply lip balm throughout the day. Fianlly, I always carry a card case. Because of my line of work, I often have to give people my business card. That's why I usually carry a **(surplus)** of cards.

A: It's so dry and cold today. My lips are chaped.
B: Oh no. Your lower lip is bleeding. Do you have any lip balm?
A: I don't have any on me. I have some at my desk.
B: I have some in my pocket if you need it.
