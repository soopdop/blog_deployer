# Dictation
## Talk about your social skills

I don't have a fussy personality, so I usually get along with people well. I have a lot of friends that I meet up with often, and I am on good terms with my coworkers too. I've never really made a **(consicous effort)** to develop my social skills. I just **(treat)** people at face value and I try to walk in their shoes. This way, most people realize that I'm sincere, and we can maintain a good relationship. Of course, I **(butt)** heads with people sometimes and their all misunderstandings. There are also strange people whose acntions are beyond explanation. Even then,  most problems can be solved by being patient. I think the best social skill is to give one's all when dealing with the people around us.

A: Hey, is something wrong? Why aren't you talking to anyone?
B: I'm comfortable where I am. Don't worry about me.
A: But this is a party. You should meet people and talk to them.
B: You know how I am. I'm a bit of a loner.
