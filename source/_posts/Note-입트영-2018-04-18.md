# Dictation
## Talk about your brothers and sisters

I grew up in a family with siblings. I have two older sisters and a younger brother. The age gap between my sister and me is two years. We are much older than our brother. He was a late child. Our parents had him late in life ater giving birth for three daughters because they wanted a son. My brother was **(doted)** upon from a young age. He had a monopoly on care and attention from his parents and sisters. We are all grown up now, so we get on well. Of course, there were rough patches when each got hitched because we had issues with each other's spouses. However, we put that behind us as we grow older. We realize that family comes first.

A: You seem to be getting along well with your brother.
B: Yes, he is one of my closest friends. We talked to each other a lot.
A: Didn't you fight a lot when you were younger?
B: We did, but not any more. It's water under the bridge.
