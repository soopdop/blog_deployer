## Talk about how you use the microwave at home

The microwave oven is an indispensible appliance that I use almost on a daily basis. People eat a lot of instant food these days, so living without a microwave is very inconvenient. When I make rice on a rice cooker, usually there are leftovers. Instead, I buy large quantities of instant rice, and heat them in the microwave one at a time. When I have an upset stomach, I also heat up instant porridge in the microwave. Also, I usually keep leftover food in the refrigerator, so I reheat it in the microwave when I eat it later. When I ordered delivery, and I have leftover pizza or chicken, I keep it in the refrigerator. Then I can heat it up whenever the mood **(strikes)** me. Also, I don't like drinking milk when it's too cold. So, I sometimes heat it up to room temperature.

A: When are we having dinner? I'm really hungry.
B: Stop bellyaching. I still have to cook the rice.
A: I can't wait that long. I didn't even have lunch today.
B: If you're really that hungry, you can heat some instant rice in the microwave.
