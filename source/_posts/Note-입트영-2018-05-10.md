## Talk about why you study English

I have kept **at it** with my English study since I was a student. In shcool, English is regular ciriculum subject. I studied hard to keep my **grades up**. The main goal was to get high marks in English tests. In colleage, I had to prepare for English-speaking tests when I went job huning. For most companies these days, English-speaking grades are not a matter of choice, so I had to prepare. It was no cakewalk preparing for the first time in my life. These days, I don't study English for the **sole** purporse of taking test, I also study to take care of business matters and to travel overseas. Also, I wouldn't say no to speaking **fluidly** about pressing current fairs.

A: I took another English-speaking test, but my score is still low.
B: I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried taking internet classes?
A: I've tried everything. I've studied for so long, but I'm not getting better.
B: You'll get there eventually. Let me know if I can help.
