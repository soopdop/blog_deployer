## Talk about how you control your weight
It's **dawning on me** that keeping my weight **in** check is getting hard as I get older. My **basal metabolism** isn't what it once was, and I burn fewer calories each day. Ideally, I would manage my weight by excercising regularly. However, that's a tall order while working a **desk job**. That why I try to watch what I eat instead. I try to eat in moderation and reduce my **caloric intake** by eating a light sallad or sandwich for one meal. I also try to keep fatty fast food at **arm's length**. Driking is the big problem. It's impossible to keep dry completely while having a social life. I usally drink late at night, and I eat a lot of bar snacks. This is a major cause of my weight gain. I think I could **curb** my weight gain just by drinking less often. 

A: I'm trying to lose some weight, but I still weigh the same.
B: **what** have you trying doing? Are you just **dieting** or excersicing as well?
A: I'm trying to work out two hours every day, but I'm usually too tired.
B: You need to take baby steps. Start with just thirty minutes a day.
