## Talk about how much you care about your family

My family is my **most prized posession** in the world. They are always at the top of my list. They are my driving force even when I'm down and **out**. I can be forward thinking thanks to the trust and supoort of my wife. I feel **indebted to her**, because she always is my back and trusts me. If I **were** to be born again, I would do it all over again and marry her. I always give my **all** to be a better husband. Also, I **can't cut myself slack** when I think of my kids, who welcome me and open arms when I get home. I reserve to **redouble** my efforts to give them a better future. I put my **full weight** behind the things they do as they grow up.

A: Who are these people in this photograph. Is this your family?
B: Yes, that's my wife, and these are our two children.
A: They're beautiful. You must be very proud of them.
B: I really am. They mean the world to me.
