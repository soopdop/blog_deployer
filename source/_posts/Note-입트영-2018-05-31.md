## Talk about the things you do related to banking

People do most of their banking **chores** these days through online banking or mobile banking. You can do most basic things on a phone, including checking your balance, making a transfer, or paying the bills. People often set up automatic transfers for monthly fees, so money is withdrawn automatically. When people actually visit a bank, it's usually to consult with a teller to open account or to apply for a loan. Getting a security card or OTP card re-issued also requires a visit. People also visit banks to exchange currencies before they go overseas. It's easy to widthdraw cash since there are ATMs on every corner. ATMs can also be used to make a deposit. ATMs in convenient stores are even open around the clock. Overall, people can breeze through banking chores these days.

B: Can you wait just a moment? I have to make a bank transfer.
B: Do you have to do it right now? Make it snappy.
A: Don't worry. I can do it really quickly on my smartphone.
