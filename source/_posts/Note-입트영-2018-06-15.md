# Dictation
## Talk about your local grocery store

There is a local supermarket right next to the apartment complex where I live. That's why I usually go to shop for goceries. The store always has fresh produce in stock(?). They also sell a lot of seafood and meat. Various strings, alchole, veberages, and dary(?) products are also available. There is a corner for many types of banchan, so I often make use of it. The prices are reasonable, and shoppers can collect loyalty point. Best of all, the store can delivery your groceries to your door if there is too much to carry in one go. Of course I go to bigbox stores sometimes as well, I usually go when I'm running low on daily neccesities like toilet trees(?). I also buy pre-cooked that I can easily eat at home.

A: I'll be back before you know it. The store is very close by.
B: OK. Can you also get some juice while you are there?
