## Talk about the trend of goging on overseas trips during traditional holiday
Back in the day, extended families gathered on traditional holidays and ate together. However, holiday customs have been chaning recently. By using personal vacation days **in tandem** with traditional holidays, people can take time off as long as a week. There has been a spike in the number of people traveling overseas during all holidays. Some travel with family, while other **set off with** friends. Airports are nearly overrun with these travelers. Travel agencies offer countless travel packages in time for these holidays. It's a **holiday windfall** for them. Some people worry that traditional holiday customs are falling by the **wayside** because of these changing social conditions.
