## Talk about a major problem that occurred related to recycling recently

China used to import almost half of all recyclables from around the world. However, **due** to environmental concerns, it banned the imports of 24 recyclables from 2017. As a result, the price for recyclables **plunged**. Recycling companies in Korea stop collecting scrap plastic because they didn't any profit, this create a huge problem. Scrap plastic bags started to pile up at apartments. The Korean gorvernment **belatedly** took measures to solve the problem. It started to pay subsidies to recycling companies that collected scrap plastic. It also found new countries to export the recyclables to. The problem was solved, but there is always the risk of this problem reoccurring.
