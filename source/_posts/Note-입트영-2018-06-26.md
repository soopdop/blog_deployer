# Dictation
## Why do you think vacations are important?

I think vacations are very important. That's because people need to get some rest. If they continue to work without taking breaks, they can get **burnt** out. Average people take at leat two to three weeks off every year for their vacations. They sometimes go on trips, or just stay at home to wind down and relax. Vacations at home are the best way for people to regain their energy. Trips to various locations, on the other hand, can blow new life into people's lives. People experience new cultures and enjoy local foods. They can bring back good memories from those trips. When people come back from their vacations, they are likely to be well-rested. They will be more motivated to work hard again. They can work more efficiently and productively.
