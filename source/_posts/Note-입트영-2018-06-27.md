## Talk about how transportation is gotten better over the years

Transportation has become a lot better over the years. First, many means of transport have become a lot faster. For example, trains have become much faster than in the past. Korea has bullet trains called the KTX and SRT. It takes half the time to get somewhere on trains now. Plus, it costs a lot less to take flight these days. Thanks to low-cost carriers plane tickets have become much cheaper. Also, Some flights only cost half the price compared to the past. Driving has become much easier because we now have GPS. We don't need to rely on paper maps anymore. The GPS tells us where to go. So, all in all, traveling from one place to another has become a lot easier due to the advancements in transportation.
