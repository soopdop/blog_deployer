# Dictation
## What do you talk about with your friends most often?

I talk about various types of topics with my friends. First, when we meet up, we talk about how each other is doing and do a lot of catching up. We talk about what is going on our lives and share each other's stories. Plus, We talk about our mutual friends or family members. We often ask for each other's advice for issues related to our children. Next, we talk our carriers and our goals. We talk about work-related issues or future prospects. Also, we talk about descent restaurants or fancy bars we liked. We often recommend good places to each other. Last but not least, we also talk about trips we went on. We share information about good vacation spots and offer tips for future trips.
