## Talk about what are some factors you consider when you choose a coffee shop
When it comes to coffee shops, my friends and I often do searches online for good places. We keep a list of places to go to and check them out when we have time. When choosing a coffee place, we first **take into account** the mood. Some places have great views or have fascinating interior designs. The **ambiance** of cafe helps us enjoy our drinks. Next, we consider the taste of coffee. Some places roast their own beans and serve gourmet coffee. Last of all, we **take into consideration** the price of the drinks. We like to get good deals when we go out for coffee. We don't like having **to pay through our noses** just for a drink. So, we always make sure that the prices are reasonable before we actually go to a coffee place.
