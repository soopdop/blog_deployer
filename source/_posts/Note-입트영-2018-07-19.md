# Dictation

## Talk about when people choose to tell lies in their lives

Sometimes in life, people **stray from the truth**, even if they don’t mean to. Rather than lying to hurt others they tell white lies to get out of the pickle or to spare someone’s feelings. For example, people might seek someone’s understanding by making up an excuse when they can’t keep their word. There are times when people lie out of consideration for others, but more often they lie to save face. These lies are common in both work related settings and personal relations. At times, lying can help to solve problems. But in the end, people lie to cover up lies and fall into **오 비셔스? a vicious** cycle. When someone finds out about the lie, it can make matters worse. That’s why people usually learn that honesty is the best policy in any situation.
