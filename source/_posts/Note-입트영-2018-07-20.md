## Talk about the house work you do at home

I am a bit of a neat freak, so I clean up often. I run the vacuum cleaner almost every day, and I mop the floor at least every other day. I use a rag to wipe away dust, so that it doesn’t build up in the corners. I don’t like it when dirty dishes get backed **up** in the sink, so I do the dishes right after eating. After I take a shower, I spray down the floor to clean it. There is a lot of hair and dust, so I clean the bathroom almost on a daily basis. I use a brush to wipe down the toilet. I do the laundry several times a week. I separate the whites and the colors, and wash each. I also take out the trash often.  I take put recyclables twice a week and get rid of food waste right away. I do a lot of housework because I feel more refreshed when the house is **스피킨스 밴? spick and span.**
