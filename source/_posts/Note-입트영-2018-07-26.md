## Talk about how people get their drinking water

Most homes in Korea have a water purifier. Usually, I provide both hot and cold water. They can filter out and pure impurities, so the user can dink water that is crystal clear. Some products are also ice dispensers, so there’re very convenient. Maintenance providers visit regularly, to clean the water purifiers, and switch out the filters. Of course, there some households that buy bottled water. Some **바이린? 볼켓? buy it in bulk at** supermarkets, but others have it delivered to their home. Most households drink water from large capacity bottles. At various outdoor events, people often drink water from hand-held bottles. It’s convenient because people can have one a piece. People who live near mountains, sometimes drinks spring water. However, this is not a wide spread practice like it was before.
