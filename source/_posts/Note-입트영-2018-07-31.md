## Talk about fashion and style

I have my own personal style when it comes to fashion. I sometimes follow the latest trends, but usually I follow my own style. I just wear things that look good on me when I try them on. Most of the time I like to dress casually. I steer clear of clothes
that are a tight fit. I sweat the details with my outfit when I go to formal occasions such as weddings. I also dress differently from season to season. In the summer, I wear lighter fabrics to avoid the heat. I finish the look by accessorizing. In the winter I wear coats or **puffer** jackets, and **add flair** with items like **scarves**. I like to wear lighter colors in the summer, and darker colors in the winter. There is a lot of information on clothes online these days. So I keep it i mind when I want to mix up my style.
