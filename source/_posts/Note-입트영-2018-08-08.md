## Talk about the symptoms you go through after coming back from trips

When I return from a trip, I often ache all over, as if I have been **beaten up**. The build-up fatigue here and there catches up with me, and I show the symptoms. The symptoms are especially **long-haul** flights. Muscle pains get bad when I participate in outdoor activites while traveling. Also, I often get a deep **tan** because I was exposed to direct sunlight for a long periods of time. Even when I apply sunscreen, my skin sometimes hurt when I get sunburned. Finally, I also suffer from jet-leg often. When I travel to countries in differents time zones, I often **toss and turn** at night after I come back. I also feel drowsy during the day time. After an enjoyable trip, it's important to get over this post travel fatigue. It's best to stay at home and take ti easy, or get a massage to losen the muscles.
