# Dictation
## Talk about how much you care about your nephews or nieces

My sister is married and I have a nephew. I can get enough of him because I witness everything for my sister's pregnancy to her going into labor and the baby's growth. I miss him even if **we're apart** for just few days, and my displays of **affection** are over the top. I might not buy thing I need, but I'm more than happy to buy things my nephew want. My profile photo for my social media account is my nephew's first birthday portrait. I have no plans to get married, so my nephew feels even closer to my heart. Every moment I'm with my nephew makes me happy. I'm filled with graditude for the way he makes me laugh. His birth is one of the gratest gifts ever **베스토드? bestowed** upon me. I really am a fool for my nephew.
