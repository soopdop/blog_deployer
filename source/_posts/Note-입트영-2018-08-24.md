## Talk about the various types of cell phone accessories that you personally use

I recently got a new phone because it's the latest model I put it in a clear case. I wanted to protect it from geting **딩덥? ** if I drop it. I can **턱? ** a credit card into the case. This is convenient because I don't need to have my wallet on me. I also put a ring grip on the back, so that I can hold it with my finger. The ring functions as a phone cradle, so I can proper(?) my phone on a table and watch vedio. The phone's battery drains quickly, so I also carry a battery pack. The battery capacity is high enough to fully charged phone once. It's convenient when the phone's batery goes dead. I also bought a new phone holder for my car. It's the latest thing. It can be a just (??) to fit any phone and it charges the phone, too. It's great because I can charge my phone while using a sat-nav app as I drive.
