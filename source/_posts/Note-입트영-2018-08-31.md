## Talk about the various types of bracelets people use

When I’m out and about, it’s much more common to see people wearing bracelets than before. Countless bracelets are on display at accessory shops. It’s not just **또 잘못 들음 metal** bracelets with decorative gems. **Some are** crafted from leather or plastic. Others are made by stringing together **beads** on a rubber band. There also stores that everything you need to make your own personalized bracelets. People often engrave their initials on bracelets, too. Some people create styles by mixing and matching several bracelets at once. Their color-coordinate with their clothes or other accessories, too. As a result, some people have piles of bracelets, not just one. Bracelets also make great gifts. Often, friends get friendship bracelets and couples get matching bracelets.
