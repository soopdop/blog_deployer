# Dictation

## Talk about some traffic regulations in Korea.

Korea has many local regulations to manage traffic. First, Korea's roads use right-hand traffic. Inside, the cars are left-hand drive. Each road has a speed limit, and many have speed traps or traffic enforcement cameras. Some cameras record **speeding** drivers in specific locations, but others are average speed cameras. There are also cameras to crack down **on** illegal parking. During special periods such as national events, the traffic police double down **on** catching drunk drivers. Korea’s highways are all toll roads. Every segment has a tollgate. The toll can be paid automatically when passing the tollgate using an **onboard** device. Bus lanes in urban areas are set aside for the smooth operation of the buses. Other cars that use the bus lanes must pay a stiff fine if they are caught.
