# Dictation

## Describe various types of personalities

Some people have easy-going personality. They don't get a 헤드옵? themselves and they act cool 헤데들리?. They are paitient and usually don't lose their cool. There are also lazy people. They slack off and put off doing what they have to do. They do everything at the last minute. Some people I know have great presents(?) of mind. They have sound(?) judgement of what's right and wrong. They can let in just slide, so they do something to right or wrong. There are also people who are shy. They don't like to stand out in front of others, and they are very self-conscious. I think my own personalty is very honest. I don't hesitate to speak what's on my mind, and I don't often lie. The down site to this is that sometimes I speak 브런틀리(?) and hurt people's feelings.
