## Talk about Korean companies hre new employees

When you apply for a job at a Korean company, you start by presenting your CV. You usually include the details of your education and work experience, as well as official English scores and various certifications. You will also present the cover letter along with your resume. If you passed the first round of the application process, you will take in aptitude test. Applicants are judged based on language, general knowledge, logic games and problem solving. Next, you will have a job interview. Often there are several of them. Practical interviews are followed by in-depth interviews or interviews with executives. You receive a final acceptance notice if you pass all the interviews. Job seekers spent a lot of time and money on job hunting because they need to prepare for so many steps.
