## Talk about the importance of maintaining a work life balance

Work life balances are hot topic among young people in Korea these days. In the past, people laid(?) stress on social standing, pay levels and corporate images when choosing a career path. But for younger generations these days, the amount of personal time they can have is another factor to consider. Employee benefits and workload intensity are the top priorities when landing a job. Instead of jobs where they are recognized for putting in the hours, they prefer the 리셔? to enjoy the little things. They want to have hobbies and the time to enjoy them. Even if the terms and conditions are good, they don’t want jobs where they will have work late or on weekends. Work like balance has become the indicator of happiness.
