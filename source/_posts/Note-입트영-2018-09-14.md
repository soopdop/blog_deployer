# Dictation

## Describe various emotion you have felt in the past

I have felt moved in the past. Tears welled up before I knew it. It really felt overwhelming. Other times, I was on cloud 9 and I jumped up and down in place. I shouted at the top of my lungs with my friend because we’re so happy. Sometimes I have felt let down. I got down on myself and it was hard to swallow. I was out at a dead end, not knowing how to overcome the situation. On other occasions, I was so taken aback that I was dumbfounded. I **beggared belief** how strangely some people acted. A few times I was seeing red. I got so angry that I couldn’t rein myself in. Let yelled swear words. I wanted to shout and throw things. Finally, I sometimes felt self-doubt. I didn’t know how I would carry on. I felt so blue that I tossed and turned at night.
