# Dictation

## Talk about your taste in food

I'm a picky eater. I rarely eat foods that aren't my cup of tea. I like bold flavors with lots of seasoning. I also like dishes that have a **킥? kick**. I don't like food that tastes wishy-washy. I try to eat healthy. I try to have a balanced diet including meat and vegetables. I have made it a habit to eat in moderation. When I cook at home, I use organic ingredients and try to cut down on the use of artificial seasoning. Some people I know **are hearty** eaters. They have a good appetite, so there are almost no food that they **shy** away from. Whatever they have when they eat out or cook at home, the food hits the spot and they don't worry about it. Eating so well can make it easy to put on weight.

# Conversation

A: Have you tried the fried fish at this restaurant? It's delicious.
B: I don't usually like fish because it smells. Are you sure it's good?
A: Take my word for it(나만 믿어). You'll want to eat it every day.
B: OK. I'll try it. If I don't like it, will you trade dishes with me?
