## Talk about morgage loans

When people take the plurnge and the 싸인? to buy the house, they often take out a loan. They usually get a morgage loan from a bank with a house as 콜레러롤?. Most banks have long term morgage products with relatively low interest rests. The interest rate is heavily dependent on one's credit rating and trade performance. Often, the size of the loan also depends on an indivisual's income level. There're two systems. Floating interest and fixed interest. I recently received the loan from a bank to buy house. At first, I was going to get a credit loan. However, the loan of amount was too low, so I took out a morgage. I received the half of the house's price. I set the repayment period as 20 years. I have to pay a level payment a both of prinple and interset on a monthly basis.
