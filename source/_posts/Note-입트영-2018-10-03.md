# Dictation

## Talk about having a crush on someone

Almost everyone has **had** a crush on someone. It's a postivie emotion to be into someone. It can make the **heart flutter** and provide pick-me-up in life. We go the extra mile to be nice to the object of our affection, but if such affection is not shared, it can be heart-breaking. That's what makes crushing on someone so difficult. The more you like someone, the more you'll feel down-and-out. If the person you like takes **a linking to** someone else, or if there are going **steady** with someone else already, the pain reaches a breaking point. It feels like the world is coming to an end, and you'll lose your drive. In time, these emotions will fade and wound will heal over. However, at the time, they're the most **gut-wrenching** moments of one's life.
