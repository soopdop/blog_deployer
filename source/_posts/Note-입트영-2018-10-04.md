## Talk about the aging society

Korea's population is aging at a raid clip. The life expectancy(?) is increasing at the highest rate in the world. Sooner than later, we will be a super aged society. As the population ages, we need to hedge against various issues. The birth rate is so low in Korea that we need to make provisions very carefully. Long-term management plans are needed for the national pension system. Since fewer people are paying, while more are receiving. Various welfare policies for the elderly are also needed. The rock of support for such welfare policies is emerging as a major social problem. The budget allocated to welfare for senior citizen will have to be hiked up. As social concensus is also needed to better take care of the elderly.
