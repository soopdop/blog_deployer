## Talk about craming

Almost everyone has crammed for a test. I remember gramming before each test when I went to school. For mid-term and final exams, I always pulled on night to study. Studying all at one made me feel spend 앤? down edge. I would have been better that study more steadily, but it was easier said than done. Whenever I cramed 어밧? way, the things I studied were wiped form memory after the test. Even afeter graduating, I had the cram on ocassion. I scrambled the study for test, I needed for my carrer just days in advance. Sometimes, I kept putting off things on my to-do list at work and I had to do everyting in a rush just before deadline. I know that to avoid cramming I need to take it steady at all times and live my life acordding to the plan.
