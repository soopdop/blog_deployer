## Talk about how often you have meat

I’m a **sucker** for meat. I often pick up pork or beef at the butcher's shop and cook it and home. I usually marinate the meat. There are so many **뤠디매이 ready-made** marinades on sale these days. All I need to do is season the meat and cook it. I also like chicken a lot. Most of the time, I order fried chicken and have it delivered. I pairs well with beer. Sometimes, I buy a whole chicken at the supermarket. And use it as the main ingredient for a soup. I eat chicken breast with vegetables, too. Sometimes, I treat myself to a steak. Steaks are **on the pricey side**, but I still enjoy them on occasion. Duck is **콰이어 an aquired** taste that I also eat sometimes. I go to a restaurant that specializes in duck. I like the chewing feel of the meat.
