## Talk about public transportation in Korea

Korea has excellent public transportation. It's not a strech to say that the public transportation around the capital area is world-class. First, there is a subway system with a lot of routes. You can find your way almost anywhere by subway. The bus system is also top-notch. The buses are color-coded depending on whether they run in downtown areas or outside the city. These days, you can use various transportation apps to check the taimetables for buses and subway cars in real time. Notice boards at stations and bus stops are digital displays. On an national level, there are KTX and SRt bullet trains, and lots of domestic flight. Traveling to different regions is a cinch if you use these means of transportation.

A: I think so. It's that big red building over there, right?
B: That's right. The subway station is in front of it. You can't miss it(딱 눈에 띄어요).
