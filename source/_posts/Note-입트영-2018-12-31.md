## Talk about fashion styles of Koreans

In my opinion, Koreans are snappy dressers. They are tuned in to trends, and are good at expressing in their individuality through fashion. Eveyone follows their own style. Some people dress casually, while others like to dress up a bit. Overall, most people wear whatever looks good on them. These days, it's easy to see the latest trends and buy clothes or fashion items online, so people's fashion sense has gotten even better. Korea also has four distinct seasons, so people dress for the weather. As a result, you can see different styles each season. Highly breathable and brightly colored clothes are popular in the summer. In the winter, warmer and darker clothes come **into** style.
