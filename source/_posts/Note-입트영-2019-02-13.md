## Talk about how you clean your home

The first thing I do when I clean my house is tge clear the floor by picking up anything that is laying around. I toss out garbage in the trash bin and put item back where they belong. I use a vacuum cleaner to clean the living room, kitchen, and bed rooms. Dust builds up a lot in the corners, so I remove the vacuum cleaner attachment for the nooks and crannies. The, I use wet rags to wipe down the floors. I also use rags to wipe away any dust from the furniture or appliances. When I've wrapped up the cleaning I close the windows and prep the trash to throw it away. I put the general waste in standardized trash bags and I separate the recyclables into different bags to dipose of separately.

B: Thanks. My husband and I clean it almost every day. We both like it clean.
A: How do you decide who does what? My wife almost never does the dishes.
B: We take it in turns(번갈아가면 해). If I do something one day, my husband does it the next day.
