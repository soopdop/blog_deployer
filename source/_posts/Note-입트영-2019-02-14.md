# Dictation

## Talk about the various facial expression we made

We feel a wide range of emotions in our lives. The face is where these emotional states are revealed the most. The face is comprised of many muscles, so emotions are expressed through various facial expressions. We can get an idea of a person's emotions by reading these expressions. For example, when someone feels **elated**, that is manifested in an excited or happy expression. A smail will **spread on** a person's lips before they know it. However, when someone feels blue or upset, they will have a dark expression. Anger will cause a flushed face, and a **grimacing** expression. When someone is nervious or afraid, they may turn **white as a sheet.** Some people are less expressive with their faces. It's hard to get a read on people who are poker-faced.
